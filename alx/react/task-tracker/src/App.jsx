//* Main App Component
/*
The App component in the code provided acts as the main container for a Task Tracker application built using React. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its structure and functionality:

1. Structure:

a. The App component organizes the user interface into a centralized container, using CSS classes from Tailwind CSS for layout and styling. This ensures the app is visually centered on the screen and has a clean, modern look.

2. Components Included:

a. TaskForm: A component where users can input and submit new tasks.

b. TaskList: A component that displays the current list of tasks with options to toggle their completion status and delete them.

c. Snackbar: A component used for displaying notifications or messages to the user, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the application.
